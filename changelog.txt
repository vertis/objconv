2013-08-23 version 2.31
* support for disassembly of AVX512F
* library operations were extremely slow on big libraries because of rebuilding and search for unique names. This problem is fixed. 
* long member names allowed in libraries
* option -ls to make member names short. Perhaps good for compatibility with BSD. Member names are made unique just by adding a running hex number, not by comparing with all previous names, which was the cause of slow operations in previous versions.
* option -ns to change symbol suffixes
* options -ap and -as to change prefix or suffix and keep old name as alias
* added missing relocation type in ELF to COFF conversion
* fixed error that often occurred when disassembling .exe files
* fixed minor errors
